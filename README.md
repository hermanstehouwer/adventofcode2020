# adventofcode2020

Trying to write this year with in Python 3.8 with:
- Decorators
- Contextmanagers
- Generators

Writing somewhat using TDD and Clean Architecture.

Not going for speed or points, but for decent code.

## Code Structure:
- **core**: core data models for all days
- **readers**: You need some file readin'? 
- **data**: the AoC input sets, and test-data
- **test**: The tests!
